## Motivation
I have seen my AMC manually enter the regd. number of every student into the website to get their result and enter it into an excel sheet,so I thought why not automate this save some time.
We could possibly do anything and everything in python so I have built a simple python script to perform the job.


## This is a webapp built with streamlit:

### Inputs to the application

* Takes in the starting and the ending regd. number
* The semester for which you would like to fetch the results

### Outputs from the application

* Pie chart denoting the percentage of students for each GPA.
* Bar chart denoting the number of students for each GPA.
* Textual data of students for each GPA.
* Dataframe of each students results.
* A csv file that is created in the root dir with details like Name,Regd.Num,GPA,CGPA.

## Tools used

* [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/) a python package to create web applications for a machine learning ecosystem

* [Selenium](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language


## IDE Used
[Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) I would reccommend PyCharm just about to any python developer,I feel most comfortable creating python scripts when working with PyCharm.
